Experiments over the past decade have clearly demonstrated that the addition of a small amount of nanoparticles to a polymer matrix can have a tremendous impact on their mechanical properties. Often times, however, the nanoparticles must be decorated with polymer brushes in order to prevent them from aggregating in the polymer matrix, which can degrade the properties of the material. These polymer brushes can be the same polymer as the host matrix, and the dispersion of the nanoparticles and the property changes they impart can depend strongly on the relative molecular weights of the polymer chains as well as the interactions between the polymer brushes, nanoparticles, and the matrix polymer. We are using a series of coarse-grained models to understand how brush-decorated nanoparticles affect the non-linear mechanical properties of glassy polymers.
