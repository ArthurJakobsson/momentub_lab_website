title: Overcharging and aggregation of polyelectrolyte-decorated macroions

It is well-known that when macroions such as charged colloids or liposomes are in solution with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, the polyelectrolytes will condense onto the surface of the macroion; due to the local correlations in the adsorption of these polyelectrolytes, they can reduce or even reverse the net charge of the macroion complex. More recently, experiments have shown that such polyelectrolyte-decorated macroions will aggregate into clusters with a size that depends on the net charge of the macroion/polyelectrolyte complex. Simulations have only begun to investigate these phenomena, and I plan to develop novel multiscale modeling techniques to examine how heterogeneity of the charges along the polymer backbone and macroion surface affect their aggregation properties. The goal will be to arrive at general principles for the effects of such charge heterogeneity to control the distribution of aggregate sizes as well as the shape and ordering present in each aggregate.
